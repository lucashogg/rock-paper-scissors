## About

> We’re going to make an implementation of grade-school classic “rock paper scissors”.

In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a Javascript based game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors." Currently, this game has no GUI in the browser and is entirely console based. Styling and a more interactive component will be added in a later lesson.
