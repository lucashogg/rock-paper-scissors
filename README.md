In this **The Odin Project** assignment we are tasked with building a Javascript based game of "Rock, Paper, Scissors."

### How To Play

-   Start game by selecting between a "Rock, Paper, or Scissors" button
-   Game will keep score count between User and Computer
-   Winner announced at best out of 5

### Technologies

-   Javascript
-   CSS
-   HTML

### What I Learned

This was a fun way to practice dynamically inserting content into the DOM while keeping score of a game. Thanks to Google, I was able to figure out how to calculate a random choice for the computer using `Math.floor()` coupled with `Math.random()`. I also had the opportunity to try a modal popup for when the winner is declared by making use of `display: none` until the game count reached 5.
